Method to make the dish:

1. Take a mud cup and fill it more than half with chocolate ice-cream. This will look like the mud of a plant.
2. Now crush some oreo biscuits(you can use a mixing jar or put them in a ziplock pack and crush it with a rolling pin). And then 
   spread the crushed oreos on top of the ice-cream. This will pay the role of fertilizer.
3. Finally, place mint leaves in such a way that it looks like a complete plant.
4. Serve it with a wooden spoon.
